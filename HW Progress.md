Arranged the site to match the same layout formulation as the image. Whats left for me to do it
    - Style up the Abous Us section image
    - Find a way to round the colors of the cookies

Also, I have not begun progress on alternating.html, will begin doing work on this once done with index.html

Finished index.html. It represents the image pretty accurately, I can go back and tweak it a bit, to add my own style. I didnt work on alternating.html today.
