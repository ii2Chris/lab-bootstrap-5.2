Delete when Finished!

There are some outline templates that I need to complete

    - Set up the header | DONE
        - able to use my own styling and classes
        - I'll just replicate the image though

    - Round the cookie images, and do the bootstrap grid to make it scale
        - Cookie section should replicate the image. 

    - About me section 
        - try to replicate the image. was told to use a bootstrap grid. Make sure I did.

    - footer | DONE
        - I have creative principles for this

    - alternating.html
        - set up bootstrap grid
        - set up alternating (see image for more info)

--  (8/31)

Arranged the site to match the same layout formulation as the image. Whats left for me to do it
    - Style up the Abous Us section image
    - Find a way to round the colors of the cookies

Also, I have not begun progress on alternating.html, will begin doing work on this once done with index.html

Finished index.html. It represents the image pretty accurately, I can go back and tweak it a bit, to add my own style. I added bootstrap grid layout to alternating.html. But I need to figure out the offseting thing that was explained in the doc. After this, all of the checkboxes will be checked, and I can just edit the site how I want.

    - Check to see if the aboutme section represents a bootstrap layout
    - Check the header function
    - Try to figure out the alternating.html alternating thingy.

    I finished all the check boxes. I just need to refine some of what I learnt. Like bootgrid for html was a bit confusing, so i need to udnerstand it better. but I finished the homework!
